# ASP .NET CORE IDENTITY using REPOSITORY DESIGN PATTERN
Beyond other advantages, using the Repository Design Pattern is practical as it allows us to increase testability and have a loose coupling with our Data Persistence Framework.

ASP .NET Core has amazing functionality tied to it, however it is tightly coupled with Entity Framework. However, you can easily take advantage if its IUserStore and its kin to customize the ASP .NET Core Identity and use your own Persistence Framework.

In this solution, I still used Entity Framework for saving, but used the Repository Design Pattern.
